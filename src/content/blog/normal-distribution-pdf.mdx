For my first blog post, I will demonstrate the classic integral trick to show that the pdf of the normal distribution does in fact meet the requirements of a probability density function and have integral 1. 

First, recall that the pdf of the normal distribution is <Latex formula={'f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}'}/>
