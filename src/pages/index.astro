			<p>
				I am Luca Nijim, an undergraduate studying pure math at the University of Notre Dame. 
				I am currently spending a year as a visiting student at Oriel College, at Oxford University. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have completed an internship at <a href="https://neo4j.com/">neo4j</a>, where I worked on the benchmarking team, 
				and have participated in <a href="https://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc/REU2023.html">an REU</a> at the University of Maryland, where I researched transition path theory.
				I am eager to gain more experience in math and software engineering.
